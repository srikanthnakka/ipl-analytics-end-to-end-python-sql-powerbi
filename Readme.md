# IPL Analytics Platform — End-to-End Data Analysis (Python, SQL, Power BI)

This project presents a complete end-to-end analytics pipeline built using Indian Premier League (IPL) match data.
It combines Python-based data analysis, statistical testing, SQL analytics, and an interactive Power BI dashboard to explore team strategies, player performance, and venue impact across IPL seasons.

The objective of this project is to demonstrate a real-world analytics workflow from raw data to actionable insights.

# Python Analysis

## Data Understanding

Initial inspection of the dataset including structure, columns, and match vs delivery level analysis.

## Data Cleaning

Data preparation steps include:

* fixing inconsistent team names
* handling missing values
* correcting data types
* removing redundant columns
* standardizing team and venue information

## Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA explores trends across teams, players, and venues including:

* team win percentages
* chasing vs defending success
* venue scoring patterns
* top run scorers and wicket takers
* scoring trends across seasons
* phase-wise scoring analysis

---

# Statistical Analysis

Hypothesis testing was performed to validate strategic assumptions.

Example test:

**Do chasing teams have a statistical advantage in IPL matches?**

Method used:

Proportion Z-Test

Result:

Chasing teams win approximately **52.6% of matches**, and the statistical test confirms this advantage is significant.

---

# Feature Engineering

Match-level analytical features were created from ball-by-ball data.

Engineered features include:

* first_innings_score
* first_innings_wickets
* target_runs
* win_margin
* win_type
* match_phase classification

These features enable deeper analysis in SQL and Power BI.

---

# SQL Analytics

SQL queries perform advanced aggregations such as:

Team analytics

* total wins by team
* team win percentage

Batting analytics

* top run scorers
* strike rate leaders
* boundary hitters

Bowling analytics

* top wicket takers
* economy rate leaders

Venue analytics

* highest scoring venues
* toss decision influence
* venue match outcomes

---

# Power BI Dashboard

An interactive dashboard was built with five analytical views.

## Overview

Tournament-level insights including:

* matches played
* total runs scored
* total wickets
* scoring trends
* top players

## Team Performance

Analysis of team strategies including:

* win percentages
* toss decisions
* chasing vs defending success

## Batting Analysis

Player performance insights including:

* top run scorers
* strike rate comparisons
* phase-wise scoring trends

## Bowling Analysis

Bowling impact analysis including:

* top wicket takers
* economy leaders
* phase-wise wicket distribution

## Venue Insights

Stadium performance including:

* average venue score
* highest scoring venues
* toss strategies by stadium

---
